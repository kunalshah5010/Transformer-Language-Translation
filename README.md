Transformer for Language Translation ðŸš€

This repository contains an implementation of a Transformer model from scratch, designed for language translation tasks. The project aims to explore and showcase the architecture and mechanisms of the Transformer model introduced in the paper Attention is All You Need.

Features

- Pure From-Scratch Implementation: Written in Python, leveraging only minimal libraries.
- Multi-Head Attention: Implements scaled dot-product attention and parallel attention heads.
- Positional Encoding: Adds temporal context to token embeddings.
- Encoder-Decoder Architecture: Includes both encoder and decoder stacks with residual connections and layer normalization.
- Custom Tokenization: Supports tokenizing datasets for efficient sequence processing.
- Teacher Forcing: Utilized during training to speed up convergence for sequence-to-sequence tasks.
- Batch Processing: Designed with efficient batching for faster computations and gradient descent.
